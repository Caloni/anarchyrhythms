<p align="left">If you are already a user of AnarchyRhythms, you probably have 
  saved patches from previous versions of AnarchyRhythms.</p>
<p align="left">AnarchyRhythms v2 allows you to import these saved patches - there 
  is an option on the presets menu to do this.</p>
<p align="left">If you have saved songs in vst hosts such as Cubase or Logic Audio, 
  which include AnarchyRhythms patch settings, these settings will not automatically 
  load into AnarchyRhythms v2. You must use your old version of AnarchyRhythms 
  to save these patches as .FXP files. These .FXP files can be imported into AnarchyRhythms 
  v2.</p>
