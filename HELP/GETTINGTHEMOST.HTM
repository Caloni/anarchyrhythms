<h3 align="left">Advice about input sounds</h3>
<p>AnarchyRhythms sounds best when the input sound contains a broad frequency 
  spectrum, as this gives the filters more to get their teeth into. Examples 
  of sounds with broad frequency spectrums: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Resonant</i> or <i>noisy</i> sounds</li>
  <li>Mixed layers of differently pitched sounds</li>
  <li>Sounds which change in pitch over their duration</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to pre-process sounds to broaden their frequency spectrums, try 
  using a <i>resonator </i>(such as AnarchyEffects <i>HarmonicAdder</i>, published 
  by <a href="http://www.anarchysoundsoftware.co.uk">Anarchy Sound Software</a>. 
</p>
<p>AnarchyRhythms also can sound better when the input sound has a <i>rhythmic 
  metre </i>matching that of the AnarchyRhythms pattern (ie same BPM and time-signature), 
  or when the input sound is largely <i>static </i>(ie not much <i>rhythmic metre 
  </i>of its own).</p>
<p>Getting a matching <i>rhythmic metre</i>:</p>
<p>Do this by setting the <i>bpm </i>on AnarchyRhythms to match that of the input 
  sound, or if the host application is a sequencer, select the <i>Host Sync </i>button 
  on the <a href="PatternEditor.htm">Sequencing Controls</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of <i>static </i>input sounds (sounds with little <i>rhythmic metre</i>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Soundscapes</li>
  <li>Sustained notes</li>
  <li>Constant-velocity streams of notes</li>
  <li>Reverbs</li>
  <li>Massively-slowed time stretch sounds</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to pre-process sounds to increase their <i>static</i>ness, try 
  using reverb or echo effects to blur their <i>rhythmic metre</i>.</p>
<h3 align="left">Advice about parameter settings</h3>
<p>If an AnarchyRhythms sound is messy or unclear, here are some things to try</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decrease its length. Shorter sounds are always crisper.</li>
  <li>Increase its feedback amount. Feedback increases consistency from one sound 
    to the next, and masks irregularities in the input signal.</li>
  <li>Increase oscillator level. AnarchyRhythms internal oscillators cover over 
    any messiness altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>If AnarchyRhythms is producing clicks, check for <i>discontinuities</i> in 
  the <a href="EditPane.htm">edit pane</a> envelope graphs. D<i>iscontinuities 
  </i>are vertical lines in the graph - these make envelope values change instantaneously 
  which causes audible clicks. Instead use a gradient, however steep it is doesn't 
  matter so long as its not vertical!</p>
